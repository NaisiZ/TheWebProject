Our ODM/OEM capabilities help our customers meet exacting specifications and requirements at an affordable price and quick time to market in harsh operating environments.</p>

			<h2 class="title margin-left-fix">Manufacturing & Support Capabilities <hr class="section-line" /></h2>

We work on the embedded long roadmap enabling 5+ years continuity of supply and support, complemented by a comprehensive stringent revision control process.</p>

			<h2 class="title margin-left-fix">RoHS Compliance <hr class="section-line" /></h2>
			<p>The European Union adopted Directive 2002/95/EC in February 2003 that restricts and prohibits the use of heavy metals (lead, mercury, cadmium, and hexavalent chromium), polybrominated biphenyls (PBB) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE) in new electrical and electronic equipment shipped after July 1, 2006.  All new products under development at Arista Corporation meet the directive's requirements.</p>

			<h2 class="title margin-left-fix">Conflict Minerals Sourcing Policy <hr class="section-line" /></h2>
			<p>Conflict minerals (columbite-tantalite, cassiterite, wolframite and gold, or their derivatives, including tantalum, tin and tungsten) originating from Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) are sometimes mined and sold by armed groups to finance conflict characterized by extreme levels of violence.  Some of these minerals and the metals created from them can make their way into the supply chains of the products used around the world, including those in the electronics industry.</p>

			<p>It is the policy of Arista to avoid Conflict Minerals that directly or indirectly finance or benefit armed groups in conflict affected regions.  Arista is committed to sourcing components and materials from companies that share our values around human rights, ethics and environmental responsibility.</p>

			<p>Arista expects its suppliers to commit to the EICC Code of Conduct which includes a provision related to the responsible sourcing of minerals.  Pursuant to that Code of Conduct, suppliers must have a policy to reasonably assure that tantalum, tin, tungsten and gold in the products they manufacture are DRC conflict free.  Arista will immediately discontinue engagement with suppliers who pose any risk supporting conflict minerals.</p>

			<h2 class="title margin-left-fix">Our Core Values <hr class="section-line" /></h2>
			<p>In a continuous pursuit of excellence, our core values include Innovation, Reliability, Agility, Integrity and Trust.  ‘Talk to us. We listen.’  We listen to our customers.  We then apply creativity, technology, engineering and manufacturing expertise to provide the optimum solution.  We listen so we can continuously improve our products, processes and services.  We listen because our objective is to work in partnership with our customers to establish a long term successful relationship...</p>
